Works

But has seemingly bluescreened my computer with a directx crash so

Perhaps not the most stable working?

But it sure works good.

大大成功

Notes
-----

Resnet:
    Does not train nearly as fast as Unet. Even at epoch 100 had not alltogether satisfactory results.
    Used epoch 55, still had a worse result compared to resnet at epoch 21

Densenet: 
    works, possibly better than resnet

Densenet with conv skip layers:
    Doesn't work



Plans:

- Try Deformable Conv Layer in UNet
- Try ResNet DONE
